Dr Wildberger

I feel like I am writing an old friend. I have spent a considerable amount of time with you over the last few years, having watched countless hours of your YouTube videos. You have been a tremendous mentor in my life. Thank you for your relentless dedication to education and mathematics. 

Let me introduce myself. My friends call me Phi. That should tell you a little about where this is going. I am an Architect. I am not a Mathematician. But over the last few years I have been called to a path of discovery - a mathematical journey into a subject that has intrigued me since my early architectural training, but I never studied until now: The Divine Proportion.

I am seeking a deeper understanding of this phenomenon. As I dwell on all the fascinating attributes of this simple proportional concept, I am awestruck and I question how it could show up in so many places and ways. What is the root cause? 

I am currently assembling my research on my latest project -  [Geometor.com](geometor.com) - a website dedicated to *Seeking Truth through Divine Logic* and sharing my sense of wonder of this beautiful phenomenon. I invite you to take a look. It is in a state of early development right now but I think you can see where it is going. 

I have the following objectives for the site:

* Establish a comprehensive **reference library** of attributes of the Golden Ratio, including: 
	* **Algebraic Identities** and proofs.
	* **Geometric Constructions** and proofs.
	* **Cross reference** with external sources and papers - especially Euclid. 
* Create a rigorous **foundation of geometric and algebraic frameworks** for the exploration and expression of the Divine Logic of the Golden Ratio.
* Share my **philosophical observations** sense of Wonder and Awe.
* Create **art and moving images** that inspires and reveals the beauty in all ways that the Divine Proportion can be expressed.

I want to marry science and art so that others may be inspired. I hope to collaborate with people all over the world, to pour over the mystery and seek the pattern that is yet unknown.

As an example of the work I am doing, I have attached an animated GIF that shows 3 different proportional systems emanating from two given points - each of them overlapping at the Golden Ratio extension of the original unit. If you have never seen these relationships before, I hope it gives you the same sense of delight that it does me.

My career has taken me from the architecture of buildings to that of web, database, software, and enterprise systems. I spent  7 years at Microsoft, supporting Federal customers on strategic solutions including the first rollout of Microsoft's high-performance computing platform. I am an accomplished designer, writer, and musician. I believe that all of this has been training for what is about to unfold.

However, when I began this journey, I was hindered by my lack of mathematics skills. Unused, my algebra and geometry knowledge had all but vanished. I felt that I was beginning anew. But I was certain to be taken seriously, I needed to follow a strict rigor. I could not determine how to do this in classical trigonometry without collapsing into decimal expansions for everything - which would make it difficult to discern any patterns. I felt it was important to keep the algebra symbolic throughout. Then I found Norman J Wildberger and Rational Trigonometry. As a result, I have established a framework of constructive geometry for this investigation. I can't wait to tell you more about what I have in mind.

As a creative person, I'm not afraid to express my feelings about the path I am on. I am compelled by an increasing and deepening sense of beauty. I am amazed by the preponderance of golden section instances I have found in my constructive geometry studies. I want to share what I am learning. And I want to make sense of what I am learning - working with the brightest and best people I can find.

Through my research and copious geometric analysis, I have begun to wonder if there is some yet unseen conceptual framework that all proportion and logic sit on - and for which the Golden Ratio is a part - as some kind of interconnected fabric? Like an inflection point within the logical systems of arithmetic, geometry and proportion that echoes throughout our natural world in endless variation.

I have a number of conjectures that are developing - but they all seem to be falling towards this notion:

> The Divine Proportion emerges as an *interference pattern* when fundamental proportions (ie. 1:1, 1:2, 1:âˆš3) are held in specific proportional relationships to one another.

Today, I live in a little cottage on the Oregon coast. About as idyllic as you can imagine. And about as far from the life I mentioned above. I want to make something new and exciting happen. I hope this letter is a catalyst for that. 

I saw somewhere that you were looking for someone to help with graphic design. Perhaps we can help each other.  

I am very much hope we can find a time to connect. I believe the conversation will extraordinary. 

Happy New Year.
