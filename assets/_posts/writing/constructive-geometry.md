# Constructive Geometry


As my study of the golden ratio progressed, I began to realize the necessity of a formal system to conduct the study - defined by a logical set of operations and a field to perform the operations in.

The purpose of this endeavor is to find and document instances of Golden sections in a constructed geometric field. We define a Golden section as three points positioned along the line such that the proportion of these distances is the Golden ratio. We want the lengths of each of these instances to be understood as a symbolic algebraic expression, not as a decimal expansion. Each instance, can then be understood as a factor of unit expression of the Golden ratio. In other words, when possible, we want to express all values in terms of rational number with the extension of radicals to represent a square root. 

We are studying relationships


## The Field

I was compelled to follow the approach of the classic geometers, limiting constructions to those that can be done with an unmarked straight edge and a compass. Turning to Euclid, I could appreciate the simplicity of his field. But there was so much missing. So many new ideas since then. So many more attributes to study in the field. 

### Position
First, there is the notion of absolute position within the field thanks to Cartesian coordinates.

### Negative Numbers


The field of Euclid is cloudy

A system based on proportions from an original unit.

In other words, everything that is done is in proportion to the unit.

as we begin, there is nothing in the field. There is no grid until we draw one ourselves, 


In constructive geometry, one thing leads to another. There is always perfect accountability. And if you follow a specific set of rules, you will be able to tell exactly where are you are. And tell the story of how you got there.

## The Elements

There are three types of objects in our constructive geometry world. There is a single data object type called a Point. And there are two relational object types called a Line and a Circle

## Point
A point represents a set of values. In the field, these values represent a position. The number of values in the field, 

Each value in the set represents a perpendicular distance from the origin.

Points are equal when their value sets are equal.

the number of values in the set represents the field it 


Point syntax:

pNNN(x, y, z)
p001(0, âˆš5/2)

## Line
A line is a logical construct which establishes an orientation based on the relationship of two points within a field. A proportion and position with a field.

These two points are the "parents" of the line. 

but any another pairs of points on the line may define the line as well.

when two line cross there is an intersection
this intersection represents 

it establishes a proportion.

In the real world, it is modelled by tracing an instrument slong a straightedge

Discard the notion that there are an infinte number of points on a line. In this system, there are never more points on a line than you have constructed. There is just a field of potential for points.

lines with the same proportion are parallel

lines with 

### Segment
A segment is a section of a line defined by two points on the line. 

The length of a segment is the distance between the two end points. 

## Circle
A circle establishes a rotation of segment or radius (relationship between two points)

In the real world, it is modelled by the compass. 

## Intersections
when we draw a new element, it will more than likely intersect with other elements. These intersections define points within the field. 

### Parallel
Euclid is in trouble over parallel
The reason is his definition of a line`


## Rotation and Spread
Angles

How to measure the spread

fortunately, we can use the properties of the elements

## Other ideas
### Poncelet-Stiener Theorem
>All Euclidean geometric constructions can be carried out with a straightedge alone if, in addition, one is given the radius of a single circle and its center. The theorem was suggested by Poncelet in 1822 and proved by Steiner in 1833. A construction using straightedge alone is called a Steiner construction.

Mascheroni Constructions
>A geometric construction done with a movable compass alone. All constructions possible with a compass and straightedge are possible with a movable compass alone, as was proved by Mascheroni (1797). Mascheroni's results are now known to have been anticipated largely by Mohr (1672).
