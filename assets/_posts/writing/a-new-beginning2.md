Today I am beginning anew.

GEOMETOR is emerging. And I would like to ask for your help.

I have had the privilege of being an architect in many capacities in my life. And that has drawn me into a fascination with the architecture of the universe. From astrophysics to quantum physics, chemistry to biology, and everything in between. 

But over the last few years I have been called to a new path of discovery - a mathematical journey into a subject that has intrigued me since my early architectural training, but I never studied until now: The Divine Proportion, also known as the Golden Ratio.

I am seeking a deeper understanding of this phenomenon. As I dwell on all the attributes of this simple mathematical concept, I am awestruck and I question how it could show up in so many places and ways - particularly in the natural world. What is its root cause and underlying framework? 

I am currently assembling my research on [Geometor.com](geometor.com) - a website dedicated to *Seeking Truth through Divine Logic* and sharing my sense of wonder of this beautiful phenomenon. I invite you to take a look. It is in a state of early development right now - still getting templates, styles and content together - but I think you can see where it is going. 

I have the following objectives for the site:

* Establish a comprehensive **reference library** of attributes of the Golden Ratio, including: 
	* **Algebraic Identities** and proofs.
	* **Geometric Constructions** and proofs.
	* And **Cross references** with external sources and papers - especially Euclid. 
* Create a rigorous **foundation of geometric and algebraic frameworks** for the exploration and expression of the Divine Logic of the Golden Ratio.
* Share my **philosophical observations** sense of Wonder and Awe.
* Create **art and moving images** that inspire and reveal the beauty of all ways that the Divine Proportion can be expressed.

I am creating a catalog of instances of Golden Sections that I am finding in my constructive geometry research. Prior to beginning this work, my research had indicated there were about 20-30 unique constructions. I have identified hundreds. They fall into a number of categories. There are patterns. I believe I am making discoveries. I just need to formalize my work and get it out there.

I also hope to automate the process. I can see a set of  algorithms that become a machine language for constructive geometry. I have assembled open source libraries for the work. Amazing things are about to happen. 

As an example of the work I am doing, I have attached an animated GIF that shows 3 different proportional systems unfolded from two given points - each of them overlapping at the Golden Ratio extension of the original unit. If you have never seen these relationships before, I hope it gives you the same sense of delight that it does me.

I want to marry science and art so that others may be inspired. I hope to collaborate with people all over the world, to pour over the mystery and seek the patterns that are yet unknown.

And you can catch a little of ubiquity of the Golden Ratio in the animated GIF on this page showing 19 separate instances from just a few simple geometric elements:

My career has taken me from the architecture of buildings to that of web, database, software, and enterprise systems. I am an accomplished designer, writer, and musician. I believe that all of this has been training for what is about to unfold. I am well suited for this endeavor. 

But while I am an architect, I am not a mathematician. When I began this journey, I was hindered by my atrophied mathematical skills. Unused, my algebra and geometry knowledge had all but vanished. I was certain to be taken seriously, I needed to follow a strict rigor. I could not determine how to do this in classical trigonometry without collapsing into decimal expansions for everything - which would make it difficult to discern any patterns. I felt it was important to keep the algebra symbolic throughout. I have gathered a collection of tools and have established a framework of constructive geometry for this investigation. I can't wait to tell you more about what I have in mind.

Through my research and copious geometric analysis, I have begun to wonder if there is some yet unseen conceptual framework that all proportion and logic sit on - and for which the Golden Ratio is a part - as some kind of interconnected fabric? Like an inflection point within the logical systems of arithmetic, geometry and proportion that echoes throughout our natural world in endless variation.

I live an incredibly simple life today. I don't need much. But I have stretched myself impossibly thin to get to this point. I am eager to raise some support so I can continue my work. Potentially getting to a Kickstarter. But it has fully been my intention from the beginning that this endeavor support itself through the sale of art, products and publications as well as ad revenue from a youtube channel. I am setting up a store where you can buy products based on the constructive geometry studies.  They are going to be beautiful - you will want to surround yourself with them. 

Constructive geometry always begins with a blank slate. So today I begin on a fresh and new journey into a world that is full of wonder for me. I want to marry science and art so that others may be inspired. I hope to collaborate with people all over the world, to pour over the mystery and seek the patterns that are yet unknown.
