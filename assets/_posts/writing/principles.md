## Rational Trigonometry
### Quadrance
### Spread
	correlate with required turn from radius to intersection point
	
	Cross Law
## Circular Movement
The golden ration seems to 
	Length of Chord
	Areas
	Is Turn Proportional?
## Algebra
	Tight integration with Geometry
	show Algebraic expressions for all elements
	This could be a primary investigation with Algebra only
	Every length can be expressed algebraically in proportion to the Unit

## Attributes of Relationships
### Duo
		Segment
			Length Quadrance
		Line
		Vesica Pisces
		Poles
		Prime Meridan
### Trio
		Trio is 3 pairs of 3 relationships
			3 pairs of points
				3 Duos
			3 pairs of lines
				3 spreads
			3 pairs of point and line from other two points
		Circumcenter
			Intersection of Perpendicular Bisectors of each Duo
		Orthocenter
			Intersection of altitudes
		Centroid
			Intersection of segments from media to opposite vertex
		Incenter
		Angle Bisectors
		Eulerâ€™s Line
		A triangle is only one attribute of a Trio
