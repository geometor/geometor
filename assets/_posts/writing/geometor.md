## The Quest for the Architect

Since my recovery from cancer, I have been obsessed with notions of geometry and proportion. My interest in the Golden Ratio, (or Phi, as the Greeks referred to it), began in college, in the recognition of this divine proportion that exhibited properties that are unique in arithmetic and geometry. And the recognition that this proportion is evident throughout nature in profound ways, particularly in the structures of living things. 

## The spiral patterns 

A most fascinating appearance of Phi is in the phyllotaxis of plants, that seem to emerge along the formation of two radiant spiral sets. These spiral sets spin in opposite directions around a single axis. The points at which the spirals intersect becomes a node of expansion into a separate branch structure, like a leaf, or a petal, or a seed. Nature echoes Phi in that the number of spirals in each set will be consecutive whole number members of the Fibonacci Sequence. 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55, etc. For instance, if you count the spirals in in both directions on the seeds on a sunflower, they will often be 21 and 34. 

The interference of the two patterns gives form to the plant


From ancient times, this proportion has been considered significant. It was discussed by Euclid, Pythagoras, Plato. The Platonic solids are fractal echoes of the Golden Ratio. It was used art extensive. 


a flood of information came at me.

## The Importance of our geometric construction

there are no rulers in nature.

all forms must extend from a previously given form. 

## Universal Hyperbolic Geometry

Norman J Wildberger is my personal instructor. I love his old school approach of talking in front of a board with notes and diagrams. When I watch him on my big screen, his head is about actual size. So, I imagine he is standing behind a black framed window teaching me what he knows. Occasionally, he will get serious, look straight at me, and say, “I want you to take a moment and really contemplate what is happening here. This is really important.” I take his direction very seriously, because when I do I gain a little knowledge and I get a glimpse of the astounding beauty of the concept. These moments change the way I look at things. I am having them daily now. I am quite fortunate.
