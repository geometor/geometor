Thank you, System76, for your recent transmission.

Much appreciated.

It gets a little lonely out here - at the outpost at the edge of the universe

Heard you are planning a mission to Thelio.

I am awaiting news of transport - I hope to see you there.


But in the meantime, we continue on our mission.

---

As you may remember from my previous transmissions

we were preparing to launch the photon PLATFORM

an integrated system of open source tools for the development, publishing and management of large, complex content sets.

Let me remind you that the System76 Pop!_OS

is the most critical asset of our photon PLATFORM.

---

By using our component languages in the way they were intended

we are creating clean, efficient and semantically rich content

enabling us to do the unthinkable - bridging the gap between web and print

The photon PLATFORM remains committed to the ideals of open source

And our broadcast channel is free.

---

Our attempt to form a launch alliance with the restaurantians was unsuccessful.

But we are not thwarted. We are leveraging the photon PLATFORM for our next mission:

The GEOMETOR project

To explore the architecture of all that is.

5 years ago, we began uncovering a mystery here at the outpost...

A pervasive ordering principle within systems of logic and  nature.

a simple ratio - hiding in plain sight.

our geometric analysis is returning astronomically cool results

---

This golden ratio appears to be everywhere.

Like an interference pattern within intersecting proportional structures

we are seeking root cause of this phenomenon - what brings it into being.

until now, our explorations have been like that of the ancients, crude.

---

That is until the development of our latest tool on the SYSTEM76 Pop_OS:

Geomtor Explorer

Explorer is a open source platform for scripting complex geometric constructions - while maintaining the sympbolic algebra - allowing the system to automate the discoveries of golden sections.

---


This is leading us to our boldest mission yet:

The GEOMETOR Deep Field Project

Like the Hubble Deep Field project of our ancestors, they pointed the telescope to what appeared to be a blank spot in the sky for 11 days, finding a thousand unknown galaxies.

We intend to point Explorer to a blank geometric field - to see whast mysteries are revealed.

We can't do it without you, System76.

We need hardware to complete our mission

Only Massive hardware from THELIO will do.

We need speed and parallel processing power to uncover the mysteries - before it is too late.

time is running out. I fear if we do not act soon, all may be lost.


You might think this is science fiction, but it is real, my friends.

We need your help.


I will append our latest work to the end of this transmission.

I've got to go

see you at THELIO

there is so much to talk about
