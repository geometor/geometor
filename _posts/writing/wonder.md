## Wonder
I love to wonder about things. I find this universe to be endlessly fascinating. And the more I look into its workings, the more intrigued I become. The complexities of structure, logic, and style extend infinitely from the most macro to the most micro until it exceeds our ability to experience or understand.

## Questions

* What is the Root Cause of the Golden Ratio?
* Why does it show up in so many places?
* how many unique methods sequences of steps to:
	* section any segment
	* extend any segment

What are the ordering principles by which elemental particles can be arranged in so many fascinatingly discrete ways?

By what process can so many complexities be endlessly unfolding here on earth?

What is the architecture of all that is?

### scale and out human experience
The physical experience of our lives here on this planet, at this particular scale, makes it difficult to appreciate the absurd smallness of the atom and the ridiculous enormity of the universe. We are in one moment enormous giants and less than a speck of dust.

Each of us is a creation of astounding complexity. The Milky Way galaxy is considered to have between 100 and 400 billion stars. The human body is considered to have around 50 trillion cells - many orders of magnitude larger. Each cell carries out its function independent of the others - an orchestrated ballet of 50-100 trillion atoms. Each with a core instruction set, is 6 foot long molecule called DNA.

The diversity of multicellular plants and animals echo forms that demonstrate the natural proportions of the Golden ratio.

Geometries unfold to Golden Ratio
As do living things.
Countless cells, Countless atoms within cells, arranging themselves along invisible scaffolds

There are many harmonics in the playing field. The number line is just one harmonic.
