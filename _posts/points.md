Points are logical constructs which represent a location.

You probably learned that points are infinitely small. But infinitely small still feels like a dimension.

Euclid defined the Point as "that which has no part." No physicality. No form.

Euclid did not have algebra in the sense that we know it today.

In the cartesian field, the location of a point represents a value.

Before Explorer creates a new point, it checks to see if one already exists. If so

Finding the distance from one point to another:

```js
function distanceTo(point) {
  var d = Algebrite.run(
    `( ((${this.x}) - (${point.x}))^2 + ((${point.y}) - (${this.y}))^2 )^(1/2)` );
  return d;
}
```





They represent an idea

Two points can establish a Line or a Circle

they are the offspring of intersecting lines and circles
