The mission of the GEOMETOR project is to seek a deeper understanding of the architecture of all that is.

Whether we look at the architecture of nature (matter) or the architecture of logic (mind) - a resonance emerges in the form of a simple proportion. Great philosophers and scientists throughout history, when encountering this proportion and its many attributes, felt a reverence - giving it names like the "Golden Ratio" and the "Divine Proportion."

The GEOMETOR Project is an effort to document the fascinating attributes of the Golden Ratio and to seek a deeper understanding of its pervasive beauty.
