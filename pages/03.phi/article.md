- divine proportion
- golden ratio
- extreme and mean ratio

===

The Golden Ratio is a proportion of two unequal values a and b where

\[
\large
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{b}{a+b}
\]

in other words - two unequal values a and b where \( \frac{a}{b} = \frac{b}{a+b} \)

The Golden Ratio emerges at the intersection of proportional systems

exists in the interference pattern of elements

and in nature
