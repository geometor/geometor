Overview of diagrams

# Grav Diagrams Plugin

`diagrams` is a [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) plugin that adds simple and powerful diagrams functionality utilizing the Javascript plugin [js-sequence-diagrams](https://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams) and [flowchart-js](https://github.com/adrai/flowchart.js).


## Sequence diagrams

To use it in an item of your site, you just have to write your sequence diagram as follows:

eg:

```
[sequence]
A->B:Hi C for me !
B-->A:With pleasure
B->C:A says hello
[/sequence]
```

The plugin will transform this sequence to display the following diagram:

[sequence]
A->B:Hi C for me !
B-->A:With pleasure
B->C:A says hello
[/sequence]



## Flow diagrams

You can also write your flow diagram as follows:

eg:

```
[flow]
st=>start: Start plugin
e=>end: End
op1=>operation: Development|success
sub1=>subroutine: Add features|success
cond=>condition: It is cool?|invalid
io=>inputoutput: Update for users|calm

st->op1->cond
cond(yes)->io->e
cond(no)->sub1(right)->op1
[/flow]
```

[flow]
st=>start: Start plugin
e=>end: End
op1=>operation: Development|success
sub1=>subroutine: Add features|success
cond=>condition: It is cool?|invalid
io=>inputoutput: Update for users|calm

st->op1->cond
cond(yes)->io->e
cond(no)->sub1(right)->op1
[/flow]


## Mermaid diagrams

The plugin supports now diagrams from [Mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) generator. Demos are available on their [documentation](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/#demos).
> Situation encountered during development : class diagram generated by Mermaid may be unreadable.

eg:

```
[mermaid]
graph TB
sq[Square shape] --> ci((Circle shape))

subgraph A subgraph
    od>Odd shape]-- Two line<br>edge comment --> ro
    di{Diamond <br/> line break} -.-> ro(Rounded<br>square<br>shape)
    di==>ro2(Rounded square shape)
end

classDef green fill:#9f6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
classDef orange fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
class sq,e green
class di orange
[/mermaid]
```

The plugin will transform this sequence to display the following diagram:

[mermaid]
graph TB
sq[Square shape] --> ci((Circle shape))

subgraph A subgraph
    od>Odd shape]-- Two line<br>edge comment --> ro
    di{Diamond <br/> line break} -.-> ro(Rounded<br>square<br>shape)
    di==>ro2(Rounded square shape)
end

classDef green fill:#9f6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
classDef orange fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
class sq,e green
class di orange
[/mermaid]

eg:

```
[mermaid]
graph LR
    A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
    A --> C(Round Rect)
    B --> D{Rhombus}
   C --> D
[/mermaid]
```

The plugin will transform this sequence to display the following diagram:

[mermaid]
graph LR
    A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
    A --> C(Round Rect)
    B --> D{Rhombus}
   C --> D
[/mermaid]

## Customization

Multiple colors are available for flow diagrams:
- **simple**: white, #FFFFFF
- **positive** : dark blue, #387EF5
- **success** : green, #9FF781
- **invalid** : red, #FA8258

# Updating

As development for the Diagrams plugin continues, new versions may become available that add additional features and functionality, improve compatibility with newer Grav releases, and generally provide a better user experience. Updating Diagrams is easy, and can be done through Grav's GPM system, as well as manually.

## GPM Update (Preferred)

The simplest way to update this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm). You can do this with this by navigating to the root directory of your Grav install using your system's Terminal (also called command line) and typing the following:
